Bamazondb

Description

This application uses npm inquirer package and the MySQL database backend together with the npm mysql package. The application is presented in two phases: customer and manager.

MySQL Database Setup
For this application to run, the MySQL database must be set up on your machine. If you don't, visit the MySQL installation page to install the version you need for your operating system. Once you have MySQL isntalled, you will be able to create the Bamazondb  and the products table with the SQL code found in Bamazon.sql. Run this code inside your MySQL client like Sequel Pro to populate the database, then you will be ready to proceed with running the Bamazon customer and manager interfaces.

Customer SECTION
This allows the user to view the current inventory of store items: item IDs, descriptions, department in which the item is located and price. The user can  purchase any of the  items in stock by entering the item ID and the desired quantity. If the selected quantity is currently in stock, the user's order is fulfilled, displaying the total purchase price and updating the store database. If the user's desired quantity is not in stock, the user is prompted to modify the order.

git clone git@github.com:ngutiboy/bamazonbd.git
cd bamazondb
npm install
